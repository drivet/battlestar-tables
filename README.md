# group-invites

A microservice to manage "group invitations". Users can create a "group" and then send out a fixed number of invites for others to join that "group". The state of the group changes to "ready" once everyone accepts the invite. At the moment this repo will be a learning exercise more than anything else.

Useful for managing the state of game invites, for example, You create a group to represent the game table, send out the invites, and then start the game when the group state changes to "ready".
